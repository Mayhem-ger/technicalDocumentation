          <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them</p>
          <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example: </p>
          <ul>
            <li class="list-element-text">Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. </li>

          </ul>
      </section>
      <section id="Hello_world" class="main-section">
        <header class="header">Hello world</header>
          <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code: </p>
          <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); } <br>
                greetMe("World");
          </code>

        <header class="header">Variable Scope</header>
          <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function. </p>
          <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement. </p>
          <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
          <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015. </p>
          <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
defined</code>
      </section>
      <section id="if...else_statement" class="main-section">
        <header class="header">if...else statement</header>
          <p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows: </p>
          <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
          <p>condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested if statements. </p>
          <p>You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows: </p>
          <code>if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
} else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }</code>
          <p>In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements: </p>
          <code>if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code>
      </section>
      <section id="Function_declarations" class="main-section">
        <header class="header">Function declarations</header>
          <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by: </p>
          <ul>
            <li class="list-element-text">The name of the function.</li>
            <li class="list-element-text">A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas. </li>
            <li class="list-element-text">The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement specifies the value returned by the function.</p>
          <code>return number * number;</code>
